      <em>Softball</em>
      <p> I've been playing softball sibce 9th grade basically since I started high school.I love playing the game now it's ot an easy sport to play you will have  to know all the fundementals already to play the game.It's a fast learning sport everything move quickly.I will continue to play the sport for my whole high  school year.Always strive for the best and what you believe in.
          I really enjoy playing the game now like its one of my favorite sports to play.I might go to college to play professional baseball.I really havent decided yet.

        <h4>2nd Base</h4>
        <p>Second base Isn't easy to play.You get all the action on second base also on short stop you get all the action.It will really tire you outfrom playing.Sometimes you might cry and swaet but believe me wheni say at the end it will all work out and all be worth fighting.Your gone have some ups and downs but like i said only those who try will succeed in life.Let this be a known fact. Don't let anyone tell you that you couldn't do nothing or be nothing.You will always be what you put your mind to do.</p>
